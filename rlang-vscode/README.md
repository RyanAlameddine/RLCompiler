# rlang Language Support


## Features

Adds syntax highlighting for comments, keywords, strings, int literals, operators, identifiers, types.

Also implements rLang Language Server Protocol (written in C# .NET Core) which adds features such as autocomplete and an Abstract Syntax Tree visualizer which will appear in the explorer bar of vscode which updates with the current file's AST in realtime. More importantly, this system gives diagnostics (error messages) so that you can see errors in your code as you write it.

> Note: rLang is not a "real" programming language. Do not expect advanced features. Do not expect optimization. This is simply a fun project I'm doing on the side.
